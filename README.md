## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project
The film query application allows a user to look for films inside the provided database by both id
keyword.  The keyword search checks both title and description.  If the user searches for an id or 
keyword not in the database the application will return a message stating so.  The application also 
allows a user to update or delete a film. Each page has a return to home option and also features required 
 fields.

# Lessons Learned
This full-stack exercise challenged us to learn the flow of the information through the different 
technologies, we felt pretty comfortable with the HTML to the controller and had familiarity with the 
database querys and the DOA pattern, we had to work through the way the controller passed data to the .jsp files.
Inside the controller we had to get the redirect from a .jsp file to a .jsp file which felt like th most complex
requirement for this project.  Finally, we had to troubleshoot the expression language syntax as it was very new to
both of us.
