## Lessons Learned
This full-stack exercise challenged us to learn the flow of the information through the different 
technologies, we felt pretty comfortable with the HTML to the controller.  We also had familiarity with the 
database querys and the DOA pattern but the way the controller passed data to the .jsp files required a lot of thought
and testing. We had to redirect from a .jsp file to a .jsp file which felt like the most complex
requirement for this project.  Finally, we had to troubleshoot the expression language syntax as it was very new to
both of us.
